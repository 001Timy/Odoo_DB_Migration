Code Improvements
1. **Class-based Structure**
   - The new version organizes the code into a class-based structure (Loader), encapsulating related functionality within methods. This enhances code organization and readability.

2. **Enhanced Error Handling with Logging**
   - The new version incorporates logging for error handling, using the Python logging module. This provides more informative error messages and facilitates easier debugging and troubleshooting.

3. **Type Annotations and Docstrings**
   - Type annotations and docstrings are added to method signatures, providing clear information about parameter types and return types. This improves code readability and helps developers understand the purpose and usage of each method.

4. **Modularization and Readability**
   - The new version breaks down the functionality into smaller methods within the Loader class, each responsible for a specific task (e.g., reading mapping files, connecting to databases, migrating data). This modular approach enhances code readability and reusability.

5. **Input Parameterization**
   - The new version allows specifying input parameters such as connection file path, mapping directory, and models XML directory when initializing the Loader class. This adds flexibility and makes the code more reusable in different contexts.

6. **Encapsulation and Abstraction**
   - The new version encapsulates database connection parameters and mapping-related functionalities within the Loader class, promoting better encapsulation and abstraction. This improves code maintainability and reduces potential side effects.

7. **Improved Exception Handling**
   - The new version handles exceptions more gracefully, providing error messages with context and traceback information. This helps identify and resolve issues more efficiently during development and deployment.

8. **Consistent Naming and Style**
   - The new version adheres to consistent naming conventions and style guidelines, enhancing code consistency and readability across the project.

Overall, the new version of the code demonstrates significant improvements in terms of structure, readability, maintainability, and error handling, resulting in a more robust and efficient implementation.
